TODO:
- Make highscores record the date of the play aswell.
- Finish salt bomb feature.
-- Explode salt onto the ground that damages slugs.
-- If the bomb itself hits the player (not explosion), player dies or some other consequence (slowed/stunned?).
- Improve slug AI a lot.
- A salt gun or perk or something where the salt bullet penetrates every slug in that lane, railgun ish.
