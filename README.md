# Slug Invaders
A 2D Java game about a gardener who has had enough of invading slugs and is now resorting to specialized methods of slug eradication.

The game has one protagonist (you, the player, the gardener) that can move horizontally and shoot "salt bullets" onto slugs which will damage/kill them once hit. 
The slugs will come in waves, you, the gardener, will need to kill these slugs before they pick up your plants and carry them away to be eaten.
The slugs will become more resistive and faster as they adapt to your salt gun and other salt weaponry.
However if the slugs are successful in stealing all your plants, they will eventually decide that it is time to avenge all their slaughtered brothers, thus killing you and taking your body as their trophy of success.

This project/game is work in progress, and only worked on now and then, as a hobby. You can't ever know when the last commit will be pushed. Maybe it has, probably not.

Originally created by me (Magnus) and my friend (Jarand) as a quick school project back in 2017. 
All code is programmed by me (Magnus/mrmag518) except for lib(s) that are obviously not, such as Tinysound and Imgscalr.
My friend had a big role in designing the original basis of the game, such as art and ideas for features and of course the original idea of what the game should be about.
